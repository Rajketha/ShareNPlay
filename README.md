2. **Open the project folder**
   - Navigate to the extracted or cloned folder (e.g., `ShareNPlay`).

3. **Run the portable setup script**
   - Double-click `CREATE-PORTABLE-SHORTCUT.bat`.
   - This will:
     - Install all backend and frontend dependencies using the included portable Node.js and npm.
     - Start both backend and frontend servers in new windows.
     - Pause after each step so you can see progress and errors.

4. **Access the app**
   - Open your browser and go to:
     - Frontend: [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)
     - Backend API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Included Frontend Build Output

- The `frontend/build/` directory is included in this repository.
- You can use this folder for static deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static server).
- If you only want to serve the pre-built frontend, simply use the contents of `frontend/build/`.

---

## Notes

- **No need to install Node.js or npm!**
- The portable Node.js binary is included in `portable-node/`.
- If you see any errors, check the output in the command windows for details.
- If you want to update dependencies, just re-run the batch file.
- For advanced users: you can also run the backend and frontend manually using the included portable Node.js.

---

## For Developers (Manual Commands)

If you want to run commands manually, use the included portable Node.js:

```
# Install backend dependencies
portable-node\node.exe portable-node\node_modules\npm\bin\npm-cli.js install --prefix backend

# Install frontend dependencies
portable-node\node.exe portable-node\node_modules\npm\bin\npm-cli.js install --prefix frontend

# Start backend
cd backend
..\portable-node\node.exe ..\portable-node\node_modules\npm\bin\npm-cli.js start

# Start frontend
cd ../frontend
..\portable-node\node.exe ..\portable-node\node_modules\npm\bin\npm-cli.js start
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see a warning about file size when cloning or pulling, it's safe to ignore as long as the files are present.
- If you have issues with antivirus or permissions, try running the batch file as Administrator.
- For non-Windows users: You will need to install Node.js manually and use the standard npm commands.
